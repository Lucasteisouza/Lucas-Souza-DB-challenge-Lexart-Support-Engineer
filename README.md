# Database challenge for the Support Engineer position at Lexart

The current repository is part of the selection process for a Suppor Engineer position at Lexart. It was developed according to instructions using the WorldDB available at https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html.

From the base tables I created a **AverageLifeExpectancy** table and populated it with the required fields.

To verify the results clone this repository and run the SQL Script using PHPMYADMIN or similar DBMS. I personally used MySQL Workbench to develop the table.
